> Have a very little knowledge about web development.


#### My Contribution:

#### Key Contributions:

The challenge faced during the Hackathon was the error caused in the app developed,which makes to recreate the entire design into a web design.
This creates a challenge for me to do both app and web design at the same time.

#### Final Thoughts:

- Learning the app will makes me to create real-life useful apps which can be useful in many terms.
